Our van has a lot of windows and the blinds and curtains that were already in the van don't block much light and you can easily see through. We decided to use Reflectix for the windows, this will also help with insulation in the cold. We got the 24 inch by 25 feet roll which was more than enough for all the windows.

We measured all the windows and added about a half an inch to them. To cut them all we used was a straight edge and utility knife, it was super easy to cut to the shapes we needed. Once they were all cut out we spray painted one side of them black to appear tinted from out side. We didn't want our windows to be shiny and reflective when we are camping in a parking lot or street.

To separate the front of the van from the back and to add privacy we hung a curtain behind the driver and passenger seats. We used our old black out curtain we had from our old apartment. To hang the curtain we used the same hooks we used for our lights. When we were hanging our lights we planned ahead and put the hooks in spots that can work for the lights and the curtains. We only have the curtains up at night and take them down during the day.
