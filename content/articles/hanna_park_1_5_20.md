This was our 9 month old back lab's (Cleo) first time going camping. For this being her first time I would say that it went very well, especially for being the middle of winter.

Getting ready for this trip we wanted to get Cleo comfortable with being in the tent so we set the tent up in our living room, put her bed and some toys in there, and both Brooke and I got in with her. This allowed her to get familiar and comfortable being in the tent and made it so she wouldn't be stressed at night. I highly recommend doing this if you plan on taking your dog camping with you.

Before we got to the campground we actually stopped at a dog park to get some of her energy out. We thought this would be best so she wasn't going crazy around other campers and hopefully keep her pretty well behaved. This seemed to work pretty well, while we were setting up she mostly just walked around checking things out. Later on she seemed to get pretty bored cause all she wanted to do was dig and rip things apart. So after we got all set up we took her on a hike so we could all explore and so she wouldn't be bored, she loved doing that.

That night we made a fire which she knew to leave alone, but just to be safe we had her on a long leash that wasn't able to reach the fire. At this point we were all getting tired and decided to lie down in the tent. We knew that it was going to get cold at night so to prepare we had our sleeping bags, a blanket and lots of warm clothes. This particular night got down to 40&deg;F. I actually wasn't too cold going to sleep, I didn't wear or use all the things I brought, but I was cold when I woke up in the morning. For Cleo she seemed to have not much of a problem with the cold, which is what we expected with her being a lab. I think she did start to get a little cold as the night went on cause she kept getting closer to me and got on my legs. It's hard to tell if she was cold or not because she is a very sweet dog and likes to cuddle up at night even at home.

The next morning we woke up around 8, it was very cold in the morning. We had a small fire to warm up and then we started to pack up. For this being Cleo's first camping trip I think it went very well. She seemed to have a great time and I look forward to taking her on many more.
